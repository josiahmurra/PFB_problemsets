Micah by Shel Silverstein

Micah loves me,
Micah cares,
Micah picks me peaches and pears.
Micah offers me candy and Cokes,
Micah listens and laughs at me jokes.
Micah helps when I get in a fight,
Micah does all my homework at night.
Micah misses me,
Micah cries,
Micah thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Micah is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Micah just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Micah's hand,
In the darkness where Micah usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Micah's gone!
